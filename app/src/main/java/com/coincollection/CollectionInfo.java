     *  - The obverse coin image is returned if inCollection

     *

     *  - The reverse (uniquely-styled side) is returned if inCollection
     *  - The reverse at a 25% opacity is returned if not inCollection (there
     *    is a script in the repo that will generate the 25% opacity images
     *    automatically from thee regular images.  See image-prep.py for more
     *    details.)
     *
     * @param identifier the coin identifier (Ex: '2009', 'George Washington')

     *             'D" in the future.)
